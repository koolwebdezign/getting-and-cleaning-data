**OVERVIEW:**

This assignment is an integral component of the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course contained within the *Data Science Specialization* offered by John Hopkins University at <http://www.coursera.org>. I am a student enrolled in the complete specialization program and it my pleasure to share my work.  If I can be of any further assistance, I can be reached here via <http://github.com> or via my personal website at <http://koolwebdezign.com>.

**OBJECTIVES:**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and to clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

Within the objectives of this exercise, I will achieve the following:

1. a tidy data set as described below,

2. this Github repository contains a *run_analysis.R* script for performing the analysis, and 

3. a *CodeBook.md* file that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

**DATA SET:**

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example:

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

Here is the data for this project:

<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

My R script called 'run_analysis.R' does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Thank you for reviewing and sharing this work with me!
